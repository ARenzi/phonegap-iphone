=================================================

- Install the package as described in README.md

- Create a new project, choose "PhoneGap-based Application"

- Open Classes/___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER___AppDelegate.h and change the interface to

@interface ___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER___AppDelegate : PhoneGapDelegateXib {

#import "PhoneGapDelegate.h"

to 

#import "PhoneGapDelegateXib.h"


- Write your "Main nib file base name" into Resources/___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER___-info.plist (eg. "example");

- Open (or rename) Resources/example.xib

- Do what you want :)
